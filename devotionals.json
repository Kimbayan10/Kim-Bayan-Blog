      "content": "Ecclesiastes 3:11", "He has made everything beautiful in its time. Also, He has put eternity into man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.\n\nSometimes we grow weary when prayers seem unanswered and doors remain closed. But the silence of God is not the absence of His work. In the waiting, He is shaping us, building our character, deepening our trust.\n\nJust as a seed takes time to grow into a tree, God's promises unfold with perfect precision. His delays are not denials—they are divine appointments in the making.\n\nToday, choose to trust His timing. Rest in the assurance that He is never early, never late—always right on time.\n\n🕊️ Reflection: Is there something you've been waiting for? Surrender it to Him and ask for peace while you wait."
