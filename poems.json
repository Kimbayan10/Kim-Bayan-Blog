  "content": "When clouds of doubt begin to rise,\nAnd fear invades the skies I see,\nI lift my gaze beyond the lies—\nTo where my Savior walks with me.\n\nThough plans may fail and roads may bend,\nI trust in Him who knows the way,\nEach step He guides, beginning to end,\nWith mercy fresh for every day.\n\nThe world may shift like winds that blow,\nBut He remains, my solid ground,\nNo matter where I’m called to go,\nHis steadfast love is all around.\n\nSo I will write with faith not sight,\nAnd let each word declare and show,\nMy future rests in Jesus' light,\nFor He holds all my tomorrows."]
