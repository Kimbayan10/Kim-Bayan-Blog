      "content": "In moments when the world stands still,\nAnd noise gives way to calm,\nI find a whisper on the hill,\nA sacred, healing psalm.\n\nThe chaos fades, the worries cease,\nAs heaven draws in near,\nHis presence pours a quiet peace,\nThat drives away my fear.\n\nNo thunder, fire, or mighty wind—\nJust stillness in His name,\nWhere every ache begins to mend,\nAnd I am not the same.\n\nSo I will pause, and let Him speak,\nBeyond the world’s demand,\nFor in the hush, His voice I seek,\nAnd rest within His hand."
